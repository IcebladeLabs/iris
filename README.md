## üëã Overview
IRIS is a neurosymbolic framework that combines LLMs with static analysis for security vulnerability detection. IRIS uses LLMs to generate source and sink specifications and to filter false positive vulnerable paths.
At a high level, IRIS takes a project and a CWE (vulnerability class, such as path traversal vulnerability or CWE-22) as input, statically analyzes the project, and outputs a set of potential vulnerabilities (of type CWE) in the project.
